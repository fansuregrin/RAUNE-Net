# RAUNE-Net
A Residual and Attention Powered Underwater Image Enhancement Method.

## ðŸ¤—Abstract
> Underwater image enhancement (UIE) poses challenges due to distinctive properties of the underwater environment, including low contrast, high turbidity, visual blurriness, and color distortion. In recent years, the application of deep learning has quietly revolutionized various areas of scientific research, including UIE. However, existing deep learning-based UIE methods generally suffer from issues of weak robustness and limited adaptability. In this paper, inspired by residual and attention mechanisms, we propose a more reliable and reasonable UIE network called *RAUNE-Net* by employing residual learning of high-level features at the network's bottle-neck and two aspects of attention manipulations in the down-sampling procedure. Furthermore, we have collected and created two datasets specifically designed for evaluating UIE methods, which contains different types of underwater distortions and degradations. The experimental validation demonstrate that our method obtains promising objective performance and consistent visual results across various underwater image test-sets compared to other eight UIE methods.

## ðŸ›–Datasets
We used 1 dataset for training and 4 full-reference datasets and 3 non-reference datasets for testing. You can download these datasets by clicking links below.

### Training Datasets
- LSUI3879
    - 3879 pairs of images randomly selected from LSUI [13].

### Test Datasets
#### Full-reference Datasets
- LSUI400
    - 400 pairs of images remained in LSUI [13].

- OceanEx
    - We gathered 40 high-quality underwater images from the official website of [NOAA Ocean Exploration](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/image-gallery/welcome.html). Then, we applied CycleGAN to add underwater distortions and degradation styles to these images, making them the samples to be enhanced, while keeping the original high-quality images as reference images.

## ðŸŽ²Experimental Results

### Experiments on Different UIE Methods
we compared RUNE-Net with eight other UIE methods (i.e., UT-UIE [13], SyreaNet [17], WaterNet [8], UGAN [3], FUnIE-GAN [6], UWCNN [7], SGUIE-Net [14], Cycle-GAN [9]) using the best model from RUNE-Net.
